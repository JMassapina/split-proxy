About
=====
Simple node.js script to split incoming requests and send them to test-target,
ignoring all responses from this target and to live-target, which responses
are actually getting passed back to client.

Used to split live traffic to stress test X (where X is a new webapp node(s),
new DB server or whatever else you need).

Use
===
Edit split-proxy.js file and set live_target, test_target and port to desired
values, eg.

  var live_target = "123.123.123.123";
  var test_target = "192.168.1.1";
  var port = 8080;

And then run it:

  node ./split-proxy.js

Notice
======
It prints 4 lines every request to stdout; if you are getting a lot of traffic
it may be quite chatty.
